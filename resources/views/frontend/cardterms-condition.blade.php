    <p>8.8 We are not liable for any incorrectly executed Transactions if we can show that the payment was actually received by the merchant’s payment service provider, in which case they will be liable. </p> 

    <p>8.9 If you receive a late payment from another payment service provider (e.g. a refund from a retailer’s bank) via us, we will credit the Account with the relevant amount of any associated fees and charges so that you will not be at a loss.</p>
